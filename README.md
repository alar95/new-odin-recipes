new-odin-recipes-project
28/06/22: This project will be the culmination of my work on the HTML Foundations module. In it i will be creating a website for several recipes on different pages and linking them to a homepage using relative links and in those individual webpages will be an image of the recipe i will be making as a presentation. personally i will be selecting recipes i have made myself as opposed to selecting random recipes and images from the internet.
my ultimate goal for this project will be:
1. creating a landing page
1.1. create an about page or have the about page info on the main page and from there users can travel to different pages using links with recipes names.
2. creating several recipe webpages
3. linking the individual recipe pages to the homepage
4. having an image on the home page followed by a brief description on what the website is for
5. in the recipe webpage there should be an image of the final product, a description of the recipe, the recipe ingredients followed by all the step by step instructions. 

i will be encorporation a website with relative links, individual images, brief descriptions and easy to make recipes that anyone can try.
